# Notes
> 2016-12-15

- I have decided to get organized so I can get more done.

- This is where I will keep my notes. 

## Guidelines

- I will use folders to provide structure.

- Each folder will contain an images folder.

- All text will be in Markdown format with the file extension md.

- Each document will start with a main heading followed by the current date as
  a block quote below it, like this

```
# Heading
> date
```
