# Notes
> 2016-12-15

- I have decided to get organized so I can get more done.

- This is where I keep my notes. 

## Guidelines

- Use folders to provide structure.

- Each folder should contain an images folder.

- All text should be in Markdown format with the file extension **md**.

- Each document should start with a main heading followed by the current date as
  a block quote below it, like this:

```
# Heading
> date
```

- Keep sentences short and terse.

- Paragraphs should not contain more than 6 sentences.

- Make searches more effective by using one word consistently over alternates.
